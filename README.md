slidify presentation for MOOC Coursera



* I'm responsible of many servers of a company. I'm fear about getting low space on disks.  
* In Sep-2011 I made a python script that checks every fex minutes free space on disks on each server of my lan and logs in a file once a day the result.   
* If a disk gets 1GB low, the script sends me a email.  

**Now I want to see the log-data I got along these years graphically**.



* I made this shinyapp

* You can choose server and the the page shows you only the disks that has the server.

* You can select a range date to show the data too.

* In another tab you can see the log file in table format.

* You can see the code at this link
